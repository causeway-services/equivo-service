/** The full set of Equivo presentation registers, keyed by id, plus the player-facing list --

 * exercise spec renders through whichever register is active." Open question §3.3 in the design
 * doc (list Lakotaean as a visibly-absent option, or hide it from selection?) is left to the
 * owner; this build lists it (honest absence, per §6.3's own preferred reading of that question),
 * with `shippedFull: false` so a UI can distinguish it in its own way if the owner decides
 * otherwise later -- nothing here decides that question for them.
